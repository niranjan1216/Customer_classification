## **1. Introduction**


Retail banking institution is going to float a stock trading facility for their existing customers.The idea is to use data to classify whether a customer belongs to a high net worth or low net worth group.They will have to incentivize their customers to adopt their offerings.One way to incentivize is to offer discounts on the commission for trading transactions.The company rolled out this service to about 10,000+ of its customers and observed their trading behavior for 6 months and after that, they labeled them into two revenue grids 1 and 2.

## **2. Problem Statement**

One issue is that only about 10% of the customers do enough trades for earnings after discounts to be profitable.The company wants to figure out, which are those 10% customers so that it can selectively offer them a discount.The marketing department want to supplement their campaigns with a more proactive approach.Dataset contains past customers details and their status (Revenue Grid 1 or 2).
Task is to build a classification model using Logistic Regression to predict whether a customer belongs to a high net worth or low net worth group.This model can  be evaluated using F1 Score.
